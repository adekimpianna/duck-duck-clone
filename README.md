It's an collaborative project; the owner(Harun) of the project create a new repo generated from [the w3-validation-starter repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/w3-validation-template); invite the others member of the project (Yana & Boam) as collaborators

We cloned the repo, create a branch via GitKraken (make sure you are on master file) and then name it. On VSC it will be automatically changed to the new branch, check left bottom.

Push to Github, then check on Github Network to make sure the branch is open and a commit is there
Then return to GitKraken, checkout master file then merge the branch to master by click right on your mouse, choose the action merge.
Push again to Github and check on Network to make sure your branch is merged.
Repeat!
